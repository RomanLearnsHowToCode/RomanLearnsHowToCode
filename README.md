- TO LOOK INTO MY PROJECTS PLEASE NAVIGATE TO REPOSITORIES

UPDATE 11/02/2022
As I have promised previously I have also delivered, there are now many JavaScript micro projects, these will be added eventually on my new react based portfolio website, I am starting to be busy with interviews etc, from today I have added C# & .NET into mix.

UPDATE 23/01/2022
Hi guys, I am slowly starting to produce projects on weekly basis, I cannot code much, since my current emploment is time demanding, but this could change in near future.. I am looking for junior / graduate Q&A, front-end web developer positions, I am willing to relocate for work within the UK.

UPDATE 03/06/2021
Hi, I am trying to push all my Unreal Engine projects here in a way, that they'll be actually working! This is a bit of a hassle, however. My projects are often on the larger size and this action might require Git Hub LARGE FILES approach.

UPDATE 02/06/2021 
!! PLEASE BE AWARE I have just finished my University course and I am working on my repositories, I am uploading them as much as I can to provide a code to browse in for a potential HR or employer. 

University related repositories are starting with CI and three numbers, e.g, CI 4xx = year one, CI 5xx = year two, CI 6xx = year three
Projects without CIXXX prefix are my personal projects and will be marked with additional information.
