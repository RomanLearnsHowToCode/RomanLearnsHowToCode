UPDATE 02/06/2021 
!! PLEASE BE AWARE I have just finished my University course and I am working on my repositories, I am uploading them as much as I can to provide a code to browse in for a potential human resource. 

University related repositories are starting with CI and three numbers, 4xx = year one, 5xx = year two, 6xx = year three
Projects without CIXXX prefix are my personal projects
