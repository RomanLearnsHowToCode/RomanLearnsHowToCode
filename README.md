- 👋 Hi, I’m @Roman
- 👀 I’m interested in computer science related topics such as robotics, artificial intelligence and game development.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning JavaScript and related frameworks, on 11/02/2022 I have added C# & .NET into my new learning path.
- 💞️ I’m looking for a full time job opportunity, junior / graduate positions are my target, however I am very dedicated to work, so I can take a bit more.

University related repositories are starting with CI and three numbers, e.g, CI 4xx = year one, CI 5xx = year two, CI 6xx = year three
Projects without CIXXX prefix are my personal projects and will be marked with additional information.
